# Data cleaning

# Method 
The methods we choose are decision tree, multinomial logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine. The decision tree method utilizes > tree code from the R package "tree". Multinomial logistc regression uses > multinom function from "nnet" package. And >lda and >svm functions will come from "ISLR" pacakge. Each method will go through summary() function to gain the output for our analysis.
